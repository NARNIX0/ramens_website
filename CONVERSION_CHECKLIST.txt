QUICK CONVERSION STEPS:
1. Use Squoosh.app (https://squoosh.app) - easiest option
2. Or use CloudConvert.com for batch conversion
3. Save each WebP file in the SAME folder with .webp extension
4. Keep original files (they'll be used as fallbacks)

EXAMPLE:
Original: public/ramen.jpeg
WebP:     public/ramen.webp (same folder, same name, .webp extension)

Once all WebP files are created, the OptimizedImage component will automatically use them!
